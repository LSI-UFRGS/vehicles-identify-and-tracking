The file 'classes.txt' must be on the same directory as the script file. 
The images and its labels need to be placed on a main folder, called 'Input', and inside subfolders as many as wanted. 
The edited images and labels will be available at the 'Output' folder.

Example:

	classes.txt
	blackStripes.py
	/Input
		/Folder1
			Image1.jpg
			Image1.txt
		/Folder2
			ImageN.jpg
			ImageN.txt
		/FolderN
			ImageN.jpg
			ImageN.txt
		...
	/Output
