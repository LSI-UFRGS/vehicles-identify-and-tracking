# Deep SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric) Training

The original model for re-identification used in Deep SORT is based on the [Deep Cosine Metric Learning for Person Re-identification](https://github.com/ricardodeazambuja/cosine_metric_learning/tree/0a7937dfe44867cf6304669f13d6dfc98e036e54). Therefore, in this work we re-trained the Cosine Metric Learning model on the [Vehicle Re-Identificaton in Context (VRIC) dataset](https://qmul-vric.github.io/).  

We are sharing [a notebook with all the steps used for training (runs on Google Colab)](https://github.com/ricardodeazambuja/cosine_metric_learning/blob/0a7937dfe44867cf6304669f13d6dfc98e036e54/Cosine_Metric_Learning_on_VRIC.ipynb) as well as [the final model](https://github.com/ricardodeazambuja/cosine_metric_learning/releases/tag/vric).
